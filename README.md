## School Projects
**Kenworth-PACCAR Senior Design Project**
### Problem | W990 Hood Struts are Sized Inaccurately
- This makes it hard for truckers to lift hoods due to struts not providing enough force at inital lift off.
#### Proposed Solution
- Lift the hood with pneumatic cylinders and record the force with load cells.
- Use the measured force to design a propper strut for W990 trucks
### Controls System Design

### Pneumatic System Design
