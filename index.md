## **Work Experience**

### **Undergraduate Researcher @ Washington State University**
- **Project Goal**: To design a set of temperature controlled open lid boxes for study of climate change induced heatwaves on potato growth.
- **Solution Overview**: We combined conventional heating system components such as dryer heating elements, centrifugal duct fans, and accompanying ductwork together with an arduino based controls system regulating voltage to the heating elements.

#### **Field-Deployed Problems & Solutions**:
### After deploying the final design in feild, I stayed over a summer to continue development and provide maintenence on the product.

      <img src="assets/img/Variac Solder joints.jpg" alt="High Current Problem" style="width: 100%;">
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> High current draw heats up solder joints, melting and disconnecting internal wiring or blowing 20A fuse.</p>

      <img src="assets/img/30amp Variac.jpg" alt="High Current Solution" style="width: 100%;">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> New power supply supports higher continuous and peak current draw </p>

      <img src="assets/img/TC testing.jpg" alt="TC Sensors Problem" style="width: 100%;">
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Thermocouple sensors in field reported erroneous readings. After testing several factors while sensors are submerged in an ice bath (0C) it was observed that polarity of certain TC's were reversed, and heat applied to the breakout board would cause a temperature increase, adding to innacuracy. </p>

      <img src="assets/img/RTD Logger.jpg" alt="TC Sensors Solution" style="width: 100%;">
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> RTD Sensors preformed more accurately than TC sensors within our temperature range. Newly accurate system will now allow for smother control of voltage in control algorithm. </p>

## **Projects**

### **Kenworth-PACCAR Senior Design Project**
#### **Problem**  
W990 Hood Struts are sized inaccurately, not providing enough assistance for initial hood lift-off.  

#### **Solution**  
- Use pneumatic cylinders to lift the hood.  
- Record forces at the strut mounting points using load cells to design a properly sized strut.
