## **Projects**

### **Kenworth-PACCAR Senior Design Project**
#### **Problem**  
W990 Hood Struts are sized inaccurately, making it difficult for truckers to lift the hood. 

#### **Proposed Solution**  
- Use pneumatic cylinders to lift the hood.  
- Record forces using load cells to design a properly sized strut.  

#### **System Design**
- **Control System Design**: Designed to manage lift forces efficiently using load cells and pneumatic controls.
- **Pneumatic System Design**: Configured to provide smooth, controlled lift operation.
