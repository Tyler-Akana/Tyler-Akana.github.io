## **Projects**

### [**Kenworth-PACCAR Senior Design Project**](projects/kenworth_w990.md)
#### **Problem**:
W990 Hood Struts are sized inaccurately, making it difficult for truckers to lift the hood.

#### **Solution**:
- Lift the hood using pneumatic cylinders.  
- Measure forces using load cells to design proper struts.  

#### **Design Work**:
1. **Control System Design**
2. **Pneumatic System Design**
