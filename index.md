## **Work Experience**

### **Undergraduate Researcher @ Washington State University**
- **Project Goal**: To design a set of temperature controlled open lid boxes for study of climate change induced heatwaves on potato growth.
- **Solution Overview**: Our solution combines off the shelf componnents such as dryer heating elements, and centrifugal duct fans along with an arduino based controls system to regulate voltage to the heaters, and thus the temperature of the box. We also explored an air curtain system to keep heated air from escaping, and reducing the cooling effect of wind but ultimately left the system unfinished due to time constraints.

### **Field-Deployed Problems & Solutions**:
#### <p>Our final design was deployed in May of 2024 in a field 2hrs out from W.S.U. in Othello, WA. I stayed over a summer to continue development and provide maintenance on the design.<p> 
#### <p>I focused my efforts on increasing reliability of power delivery and sensor systems, and decreasing variability in temperature distribution. While I focused on those three problems I also provided maintenence and fixes for other problems such as electrical faults, and water ingress. With each problem I faced I was able to respond with a unique solution, off the shelf part, or fix in a timely matter.<p>

## **Projects**

### **Kenworth-PACCAR Senior Design Project**
#### **Problem**  
W990 Hood Struts are sized inaccurately, not providing enough assistance for initial hood lift-off.  

#### **Solution**  
- Use pneumatic cylinders to lift the hood.  
- Record forces at the strut mounting points using load cells to design a properly sized strut.
